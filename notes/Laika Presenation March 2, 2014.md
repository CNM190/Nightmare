#LAIKA -- Storyboarding
### The Process
* plan the action from above with a schematic diagram
* top-down plan + camera + characters
* do thumbnailing
* which axis should action travel on? (xyz)?
    * X is like observer
    * Y is like God
    * Z is like participant?
* tight, medium, or wide framing?
* screen direction (right to left, etc).
* Be aware of previous shot, following shot, and principle of causality
    * Every scene can be connected with "therefore" or "but"
* Line of Action important
* short lens or long lens? line of convergence?
* 

### Resources
* On Directing Film -- David Mamet

### Mistakes
* Too long, yeah we know that.
* Trying to make all shots interesting
    * Don't make every shot stimulating.
    * Cut around the action, providing information along the way
    * Help the audience find meaning, don't throw meaning at them
* Don't give more information than absolutely necessary.
