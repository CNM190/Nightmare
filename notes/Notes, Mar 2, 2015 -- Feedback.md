#Initial Thoughts
* Guy is initially confused -- not sure what happens after defeat. 
* This is probably because of fx not in yet. 

###Bedroom 1
* A beat longer to have here struggling in the nighmare
* Show school stuff?

###Hallway 1
* Run at the end of the scene
* Bring nightmare more in frame.

###Charge1 + Charge2
* Start Emily centered in frame, move camera to accomodate Candy as it enters scene.
* Have her standing up would be nice. I think. 
    * Start with one foot on ground, on foot on knee.
    *  Cut to next shot, but show her coming up to standing.
* Jarring cut between this scene and next scene.
* Get her on horse? Harder
* Cut to big monster, let Emily enter scene. Don't care how she got onto horse
* Make next shot be ghosts collecting, let Emily enter scene.
* Turn gaze slightly towards camera, when Emily steels resolve. Bring camera more to monster's POV


###Charge3
* Really sell the warmth of the unicorn, have Candy acknowledge Emily
* Graphic Match camera angle is fine.

###Bedroom 2
* Show school stuff?

###Credits
* Demonstrate real world effects parallel from nightmare.
* Bring bully or something -- a micro story
* He wants to get it without thinking.
* **Mimic shot composition almost exactly !!!**


###FX
* Monster evaporating, embers should go up in cloud, to come down later.

###Shaders
* Great work on shader.

###Color/Pre-Production
* Shading for Nightmare has graded falloff, maybe seamslessy transforms into smooth, realistic shader for real life.
