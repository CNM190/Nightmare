#Notes - Dec 10 2014

- 13 seconds -- Top down shot, her in fetal position
then close up of her, light shines down, horse not visible.
Then horse reveal. 

- Camera work for exiting the darkness shots?
  Might be able to shave some seconds while including a wide shot of landscape.
  Then again, might not.

- Massive monster shot - might want point of view, from feet, move to top

- Need Emily to say something in fade to black?
